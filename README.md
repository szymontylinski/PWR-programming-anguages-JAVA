üü¶ Java Projects ‚Äì Programming Languages (Wroc≈Çaw University of Science and Technology)
This repository contains a set of 6 Java projects developed as part of the Programming Languages course at Wroc≈Çaw University of Science and Technology (academic year 2024/25).
Each project is located in a separate folder and showcases different aspects of Java programming ‚Äì from basic logic, through GUI, up to concurrent programming and network communication.

üìò Project Descriptions
2. Loops, Conditionals, Exceptions
Topic: Intelligent support system for industry conferences.
Implementation of a metaheuristic resource allocation algorithm.
Use of a genetic algorithm to match participants with others sharing similar interests.
Exception handling and input validation.
3. Data Containers
Topic: Simplified feedback flow system in a company.
Business logic separated from the text-based interface (layer separation).
Data validation and error handling.
Application compiled and run as a JAR file.
4. GUI (Swing, JavaFX)
Topic: Fitness Tracker application.
Graphical user interface built with Swing/JavaFX.
Recording workout results and displaying them in charts.
Export as an executable JAR file.
5. Concurrent Programming
Topic: Visualization of Conway‚Äôs Game of Life.
Thread synchronization using CountDownLatch.
Implementation with two data structures:
one for reading the board state,
another for updating it.
Structures swapped during thread synchronization.
6. TCP/IP Sockets + RMI
Topic: Tic-tac-toe game in a client-server architecture.
RMI used for connecting players.
Server responsible for game logic (pairing, state initialization, move exchange, I/O validation).
Support for multiple simultaneous players (e.g., game rooms or session tokens).
Player statistics (wins, draws, losses).
Console logging of key events (pairing, errors, game end).
